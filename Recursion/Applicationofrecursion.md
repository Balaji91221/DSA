# Application of Recursion
## Many algorithms are based on Recursion 
     --> dynamic programming ,
     --> divide and conquer(mergesort,quicksort, binarysearch),
     --> backtracking,
# Many Problems inherently recursion  
                                        --> Tower of Hanoi
                                        --> DFS based traversals(DFS of graph and inorder /preorder /postorder traversals of tree)```
