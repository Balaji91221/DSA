# DSA: The Series by takeUforward and Greeks for Greeks

Welcome to the "DSA: The Series" repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive learning resource for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a series of video lectures and associated materials.

## Overview

- **Focus on Logic**: DSA: The Series doesn't emphasize any specific programming language but rather places a strong focus on building your logic and problem-solving skills.

- **Pseudocode Approach**: The core philosophy of this series is to teach DSA concepts using pseudocode. This approach enables learners to understand and apply DSA principles in any programming language.

- **Programming Languages**: While the initial videos may demonstrate concepts using C++, you can watch other YouTube videos for Java-specific tutorials. However, the DSA: The Series materials primarily rely on language-agnostic pseudocode.

- **Code Examples**: To facilitate practical implementation, you can find code examples in your preferred programming language in the accompanying notes and articles. These resources complement the video lectures and help you apply the learned concepts.

## Contents

This repository contains the following resources:

- **Video Lectures**: The core of DSA: The Series, featuring in-depth explanations and examples of various DSA concepts.

- **Notes and Articles**: Supplementary materials providing code examples and further explanations in various programming languages.

- **Contributions**: We welcome contributions from the community. If you have code examples or additional resources related to DSA, feel free to submit pull requests.
