# Dynamic programming
## in simple words ,it is optimization over plan recursion 
## this idea  is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when there are overlapping subproblems
### they are two ways to calculate 
### 1.memoiation(top down)
### 2.tabulation(bottom up )


## Application of Dp
### Bellman Ford Algorithm
### Floyd warshall Algorithm
### Diff Utility (LCS)
### Search clossed words(edit distance)
### Resource Allocation(0-1 knapsack)
